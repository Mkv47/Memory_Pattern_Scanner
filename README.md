# Memory Pattern Scanner

A C++ tool designed for scanning process memory on windows to detect specific byte patterns. Ideal for reverse engineering, debugging, and memory analysis.

## Features

- Pattern-based memory scanning with wildcard support (`??`)  
- Uses the Boyer-Moore algorithm for efficient pattern searching  
- Real-time scanning of running processes  
- Efficient and modular design for easy integration  

## Usage

1. Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., Visual Studio).  
2. Run the executable with appropriate permissions to access target process memory.  
3. Configure the pattern and process ID or name to scan against.  

## Technologies

- C++  
- WinAPI (for process and memory management)  
- Boyer-Moore pattern searching algorithm  

## Security and Ethics

This tool is intended for educational and research purposes only. Unauthorized scanning or manipulation of software may violate terms of service or laws.

Use responsibly and ethically.
